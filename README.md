# What's the basic idea?

This is a project to gamify doing house chores.
The goal is to complete your chores as fast as possible, by tracking the time it takes to complete them.
Originally, my goal was to have page with chores, and each chore have a list of records/times associated with it.
However, that could be discouraging, since after many times it could be too difficult to improve your time.
I decided to be able to split a chore into multiple "events". For example, a chore could be "Dishwashing", and its events "Winter 2023" and "Summer 2024", for example. This way, you can reset the difficulty anytime (so to speak), without losing your previous records.
